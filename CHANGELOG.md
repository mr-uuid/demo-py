- [ ] Move stuff regarding spacy word vis to demo-py!
- [ ] Make a sample of the different tools at my disposal and how they are used ...
	- [ ] Have this example be part of the readme!
	- [ ] Add a precommit hook to generate the html?
	- [ ] Add it to the GitHub file too so it's picked up?
- [ ] Color of the date can vary ... if its near .. and its a todo (is and doable?) greenish, otherwise, redish ...
- [ ] Can I inject links into hashtags and stuff? it is html after all!
